Welcome to mit-news-tools's documentation!
==========================================

MIT News Tools is a package containing several tools to help with news processing.
It was developed in Summer 2020 with the Tegmark Group at MIT.
Some of its models have been integrated into the Tegmark Group's other projects, such as `Improve The News
<improvethenews.org>`_. We have now released it as a package for public use!

See Installation and Usage to get started!
